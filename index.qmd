Hello and welcome to my website! I’m Sang B. Mendy, a passionate data enthusiast with a deep interest in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, and I’m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Statistics at the University of The Gambia. My journey into the world of data has been driven by a fascination with numbers, patterns, and the power of data-driven decision-making.

With a strong foundation in mathematical theory and its practical applications, I specialize in leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. My academic background, combined with my expertise in software tools like R, MS Excel, and Python, has allowed me to work on a range of projects—from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling.

Beyond my technical skills, I value critical thinking, collaboration, and effective communication. I believe that the best results come from working together and sharing knowledge, which is why I started this website. Here, I share insights on data science, machine learning, and statistics, along with practical guides on using tools like R and Python.
