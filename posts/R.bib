abstract = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, Second Edition, is divided into two basic parts, the first presenting R packages, functions, classes and methods for handling spatial data. This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The papers explore some of the emergent and consolidated topics of the discipline, such as landscapes, cities, rural spaces, bio-archaeological records, archaeology of architectures, agrarian archaeology, post-Roman archaeology, colonial archaeology in the Canary Islands and the archaeology of religious minorities, opening new lines of enquiries and providing new theoretical and methodological approaches. An overview of Medieval Archaeology studies in Spain is offered, proposing a wide range of topics for discussion. Finally, the book explores the connections between Spanish Medieval Archaeology and other European traditions, specifically, English, Italian and Portuguese Medieval Archaeology.},

@article{Thulin2024,
abstract = {The past decades have transformed the world of statistical data analysis, with new methods, new types of data, and new computational tools. Modern Statistics with R introduces you to key parts of this modern statistical toolkit. It teaches you: • Data wrangling - importing, formatting, reshaping, merging, and filtering data in R. • Exploratory data analysis - using visualisations and multivariate techniques to explore datasets. • Statistical inference - modern methods for testing hypotheses and computing confidence intervals. • Predictive modelling - regression models and machine learning methods for prediction, classification, and forecasting. • Simulation - using simulation techniques for sample size computations and evaluations of statistical methods. • Ethics in statistics - ethical issues and good statistical practice. • R programming - writing code that is fast, readable, and (hopefully!) free from bugs. No prior programming experience is necessary. Clear explanations and examples are provided to accommodate readers at all levels of familiarity with statistical principles and coding practices. A basic understanding of probability theory can enhance comprehension of certain concepts discussed within this book. In addition to plenty of examples, the book includes more than 200 exercises, with fully worked solutions available at: www.modernstatisticswithr.com.},

It shows how bar and column charts, population pyramids, Lorenz curves, box plots, scatter plots, time series, radial polygons, Gantt charts, heat maps, bump charts, mosaic and balloon charts, and a series of different thematic map types can be created using R's Base Graphics System. Every example uses real data and includes step-by-step explanations of the figures and their programming. The open source software R is an established standard and a powerful tool for various visualizing applications, integrating nearly all technologies relevant for data visualization. The basic software, enhanced by more than 7000 extension packs currently freely available, is intensively used by organizations including Google, Facebook and the CIA. The book serves as a comprehensive reference guide to a broad variety of applications in various fields. This book is intended for all kinds of R users, ranging from experts, for whom especially the example codes are particularly useful, to beginners, who will find the finished graphics most helpful in learning what R can actually deliver.},

@book{Ummah2019a,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Covariance matrix 1 The covariance matrix To summarize datasets consisting of a single feature we can use the mean, median and variance, and datasets containing two features using the covariance and the correlation coefficient. Here we consider datasets containing multiple features, where each data point is modeled as a real-valued d-dimensional vector. If we model the data as a d-dimensional random vector, its mean is defined as the vector formed by the means of its components. Definition 1.1 (Mean of a random vector). The mean of a d-dimensional random vector˜xvector˜ vector˜x is E(˜ x) :=       E (˜ x[1]) E (˜ x[2]) {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} E (˜ x[d])      . (1) Similarly, we define the mean of a matrix with random entries as the matrix of entrywise means. Definition 1.2 (Mean of a random matrix). The mean of a d 1 × d 2 matrix with random entries˜X entries˜ entries˜X is E(˜ X) :=        E ˜ X[1, 1] E ˜ X[1, 2] {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} E ˜ X[1, d 2 ] E ˜ X[2, 1] E ˜ X[2, 2] {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} E ˜ X[2, d 2 ] {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} E ˜ X[d 1 , 1] E ˜ X[d 1 , 2] {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} E ˜ X[d 1 , d 2 ]       .

Let˜xLet˜ Let˜x a d-dimensional random vector, and let b ∈ R m and A ∈ R m×d for some positive integer m, then E(A˜xA˜x + b) = AE(˜ x) + b. (3) Similarly let, ˜ X be a d 1 × d 2 random matrix, and let B ∈ R m×d 2 and A ∈ R m×d 1 for some positive integer m, then E(A ˜ X + B) = AE(˜ X) + B. (4)},

Baik itu dalam bidang bisnis, perdagangan, kesehatan, militer, pendidikan, komunikasi dan budaya maupun bidang-bidang lainnya. Maka teknologi ini membawa perubahan pada peralatan-peralatan yang dulunya bekerja secara analog mulai dikembangkan secara digital, dan bahkan yang bekerjanya secara manual sekarang banyak dikembangkan secara otomatis, seperti kamera digital, handycam, dan sebagainya, dalam pembacaan pengukuran juga sudah dikembangkan ke dalam teknik digital. Contohnya perangkat Load Cell. Dan keuntungan menggunakan Load Cell adalah untuk mempermudah dalam pembacaan data untuk meminimalkan kesalahan dalam pembacaan data yang disebabkan adanya human error.Pada pemilihan Load Cell bertujuan untuk memilih kecocokan dalam membuat rancang bangun alat uji tarik kapasitas 3 ton, dimana dalam pemilihan ini kami memilih jenis load cell “S” karna alat yang kita rancang adalah uji tarik bukan uji tekan. Dengan kapasitas load cell 5 ton. Untuk membuat jarak aman dalam pengujian specimen ST41. Load Cell menggunakan system perangkat elektronik pengolahan data yang menjadi sebuah kurva tegangan regangan. Data-data yang diperoleh tersebut berupa besarnya pembebanan hasil dari pengujian specimen ST41. Kata},

abstract = {zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered ob- servations, such as irregular time series. Its key design goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the "ts" class for regular time series. This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.},

abstract = {The book's content is focused on rigorous and advanced quantitative methods for the pricing and hedging of counterparty credit and funding risk. The new general theory that is required for this methodology is developed from scratch, leading to a consistent and comprehensive framework for counterparty credit and funding risk, inclusive of collateral, netting rules, possible debit valuation adjustments, re-hypothecation and closeout rules. The book however also looks at quite practical problems, linking particular models to particular 'concrete' financial situations across asset classes, including interest rates, FX, commodities, equity, credit itself, and the emerging asset class of longevity. The authors also aim to help quantitative analysts, traders, and anyone else needing to frame and price counterparty credit and funding risk, to develop a 'feel' for applying sophisticated mathematics and stochastic calculus to solve practical problems. The main models are illustrated from theoretical formulation to final implementation with calibration to market data, always keeping in mind the concrete questions being dealt with. The authors stress that each model is suited to different situations and products, pointing out that there does not exist a single model which is uniformly better than all the others, although the problems originated by counterparty credit and funding risk point in the direction of global valuation. Finally, proposals for restructuring counterparty credit risk, ranging from contingent credit default swaps to margin lending, are considered.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: There are few detailed reports on gastrointestinal system bleeding in Turkey. The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of the patients with upper gastrointestinal system bleeding who were hospitalized in our clinic. Methodology: The patients who were hospitalized in Dicle University Hospital Department of Gastroenterology from March 1992 to June 2002 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: During this period of time, 296 females (23.8%) and 946 males (76.2%), total 1242 patients were hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal system bleeding. Mean age was 47 for both sexes. Distribution of the cases was as follows: 31.6% duodenal ulcer (n: 393), 30.5% esophageal variceal bleeding (n: 379), 13.7% erosive gastritis (n: 171), 6.8% erosive duodenitis (n: 85), 4.9% gastric ulcer (n: 62), 2.8% carcinoma (n: 35), and 3.5% other causes. Peptic ulcer related bleeding was the most encountered reason (37.5%, n: 466). Four percent of the cases other than esophageal variceal bleeding underwent urgent surgical intervention. Eleven percent of the cases (n: 138) resulted in death of which 65.9% were esophageal variceal bleeding (n: 91). Conclusions: The most striking result is the very high rate of esophageal variceal bleeding. This finding is in concordance with the high prevalence of the viral hepatitis in the region. {\textcopyright} H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Get an introduction to functional data structures using R and write more effective code and gain performance for your programs. This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example you'll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. You'll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You'll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R. By the end of Functional Data Structures in R, you'll understand the choices to make in order to most effectively work with data structures when you cannot modify the data itself. These techniques are especially applicable for algorithmic development important in big data, finance, and other data science applications. What You'll Learn Carry out algorithmic programming in R Use abstract data structures Work with both immutable and persistent data Emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures in R Build new versions of traditional data structures that are known Who This Book Is For Experienced or advanced programmers with at least a comfort level with R.

abstract = {Discover best practices for data analysis and software development in R and start on the path to becoming a fully-fledged data scientist. This book teaches you techniques for both data manipulation and visualization and shows you the best way for developing new software packages for R. Beginning Data Science in R details how data science is a combination of statistics, computational science, and machine learning. You'll see how to efficiently structure and mine data to extract useful patterns and build mathematical models. This requires computational methods and programming, and R is an ideal programming language for this. This book is based on a number of lecture notes for classes the author has taught on data science and statistical programming using the R programming language. Modern data analysis requires computational skills and usually a minimum of programming. What You Will Learn Perform data science and analytics using statistics and the R programming language Visualize and explore data, including working with large data sets found in big data Build an R package Test and check your code Practice version control Profile and optimize your code Who This Book Is For Those with some data science or analytics background, but not necessarily experience with the R programming language.},

abstract = {inear Models and Time-Series Analysis: Regression, ANOVA, ARMA and GARCH sets a strong foundation, in terms of distribution theory, for the linear model (regression and ANOVA), univariate time series analysis (ARMAX and GARCH), and some multivariate models associated primarily with modeling financial asset returns (copula-based structures and the discrete mixed normal and Laplace). It builds on the author's previous book, Fundamental Statistical Inference: A Computational Approach, which introduced the major concepts of statistical inference. Attention is explicitly paid to application and numeric computation, with examples of Matlab code throughout. The code offers a framework for discussion and illustration of numerics, and shows the mapping from theory to computation. The topic of time series analysis is on firm footing, with numerous textbooks and research journals dedicated to it. With respect to the subject/technology, many chapters in Linear Models and Time-Series Analysis cover firmly entrenched topics (regression and ARMA). Several others are dedicated to very modern methods, as used in empirical finance, asset pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization, in order to address the severe change in performance of many pension funds, and changes in how fund managers work.},

abstract = {R is a language for statistical computing and graphics. The R environment provides a multitude of built-in functions in the “base” package, many of which are commonly required for elementary data analysis (e.g., linear modeling, graph plotting, basic statistics). However, the beauty of R lies in its almost infinite expandability and versatility. Approximately 2, 500 (and counting) packages have been developed for R by the active R community. These packages serve to augment R's natural capabilities in data analysis and often focus on developments in various scientific fields, as well as techniques used in highly specialized data analyses.},

abstract = {This accessible text provides a roadmap for producing a high-quality literature review—an integral part of a successful thesis, dissertation, term paper, or grant proposal. Each step of searching for, evaluating, analyzing, and synthesizing prior studies is clearly explained and accompanied by user-friendly suggestions, organizational tips, vignettes, and examples of student work. Also featured are excerpts from peer-reviewed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods articles. This is the first book to focus on crafting different types of reviews (systematic, traditional–narrative, or hermeneutic–phenomenological) that reflect the writer's research question, methodological choices, and approaches to knowledge. It describes what all reviews have in common and highlights distinct characteristics of each type. The book includes dos and don'ts for evaluating studies and constructing an argument, and software suggestions for locating, organizing, and arranging sources.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Time Series Analysis With Applications in R, Second Edition, presents an accessible approach to understanding time series models and their applications. Although the emphasis is on time domain ARIMA models and their analysis, the new edition devotes two chapters to the frequency domain and three to time series regression models, models for heteroscedasticty, and threshold models. All of the ideas and methods are illustrated with both real and simulated data sets. A unique feature of this edition is its integration with the R computing environment. The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by the R commands used to produce them. An extensive R package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book, accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are available for download. There is also an extensive appendix in the book that leads the reader through the use of R commands and the new R package to carry out the analyses.},

abstract = {Title from publisher's bibliographic system (viewed on 11 Feb 2016). This sophisticated package of statistical methods is for advanced master's (MPH) and PhD students in public health and epidemiology who are involved in the analysis of data. It makes the link from statistical theory to data analysis, focusing on the methods and data types most common in public health and related fields. Like most toolboxes, the statistical tools in this book are organized into sections with similar objectives. Unlike most toolboxes, however, these tools are accompanied by complete instructions, explanations, detailed examples, and advice on relevant issues and potential pitfalls - conveying skills, intuition, and experience. The only prerequisite is a first-year statistics course and familiarity with a computing package such as R, Stata, SPSS, or SAS. Though the book is not tied to a particular computing language, its figures and analyses were all created using R. Relevant R code, data sets, and links to public data sets are available from www.cambridge.org/9781107113084.},

@misc{Soetaert2010,
abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The contents of The R Software are presented so as to be both comprehensive and easy for the reader to use. Besides its application as a self-learning text, this book can support lectures on R at any level from beginner to advanced. This book can serve as a textbook on R for beginners as well as more advanced users, working on Windows, MacOs or Linux OSes. The first part of the book deals with the heart of the R language and its fundamental concepts, including data organization, import and export, various manipulations, documentation, plots, programming and maintenance. The last chapter in this part deals with oriented object programming as well as interfacing R with C/C++ or Fortran, and contains a section on debugging techniques. This is followed by the second part of the book, which provides detailed explanations on how to perform many standard statistical analyses, mainly in the Biostatistics field. Topics from mathematical and statistical settings that are included are matrix operations, integration, optimization, descriptive statistics, simulations, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, simple and multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance. Each statistical chapter in the second part relies on one or more real biomedical data sets, kindly made available by the Bordeaux School of Public Health (Institut de Sant{\'{e}} Publique, d'{\'{E}}pid{\'{e}}miologie et de D{\'{e}}veloppement - ISPED) and described at the beginning of the book. Each chapter ends with an assessment section: memorandum of most important terms, followed by a section of theoretical exercises (to be done on paper), which can be used as questions for a test. Moreover, worksheets enable the reader to check his new abilities in R. Solutions to all exercises and worksheets are included in this book.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This book helps readers understand the mathematics of machine learning, and apply them in different situations. It is divided into two basic parts, the first of which introduces readers to the theory of linear algebra, probability, and data distributions and it's applications to machine learning. It also includes a detailed introduction to the concepts and constraints of machine learning and what is involved in designing a learning algorithm. This part helps readers understand the mathematical and statistical aspects of machine learning. In turn, the second part discusses the algorithms used in supervised and unsupervised learning. It works out each learning algorithm mathematically and encodes it in R to produce customized learning applications. In the process, it touches upon the specifics of each algorithm and the science behind its formulation. The book includes a wealth of worked-out examples along with R codes. It explains the code for each algorithm, and readers can modify the code to suit their own needs. The book will be of interest to all researchers who intend to use R for machine learning, and those who are interested in the practical aspects of implementing learning algorithms for data analysis. Further, it will be particularly useful and informative for anyone who has struggled to relate the concepts of mathematics and statistics to machine learning.},

Baik itu dalam bidang bisnis, perdagangan, kesehatan, militer, pendidikan, komunikasi dan budaya maupun bidang-bidang lainnya. Maka teknologi ini membawa perubahan pada peralatan-peralatan yang dulunya bekerja secara analog mulai dikembangkan secara digital, dan bahkan yang bekerjanya secara manual sekarang banyak dikembangkan secara otomatis, seperti kamera digital, handycam, dan sebagainya, dalam pembacaan pengukuran juga sudah dikembangkan ke dalam teknik digital. Contohnya perangkat Load Cell. Dan keuntungan menggunakan Load Cell adalah untuk mempermudah dalam pembacaan data untuk meminimalkan kesalahan dalam pembacaan data yang disebabkan adanya human error.Pada pemilihan Load Cell bertujuan untuk memilih kecocokan dalam membuat rancang bangun alat uji tarik kapasitas 3 ton, dimana dalam pemilihan ini kami memilih jenis load cell “S” karna alat yang kita rancang adalah uji tarik bukan uji tekan. Dengan kapasitas load cell 5 ton. Untuk membuat jarak aman dalam pengujian specimen ST41. Load Cell menggunakan system perangkat elektronik pengolahan data yang menjadi sebuah kurva tegangan regangan. Data-data yang diperoleh tersebut berupa besarnya pembebanan hasil dari pengujian specimen ST41. Kata},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The R environment provides a multitude of built-in functions in the “base” package, many of which are commonly required for elementary data analysis (e.g., linear modeling, graph plotting, basic statistics). However, the beauty of R lies in its almost infinite expandability and versatility. Approximately 2, 500 (and counting) packages have been developed for R by the active R community. These packages serve to augment R's natural capabilities in data analysis and often focus on developments in various scientific fields, as well as techniques used in highly specialized data analyses.},

abstract = {S is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS{\textregistered}; and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 (or later). A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data. Increased computational power allows even more computer-intensive methods to be used, and methods such as GLMMs, MARS, Kohonen's SOM and support vector machines are considered. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS and R; these and all the datasets used are supplied with Windows versions of S-PLUS and all versions of R, and are also available on the Internet in versions for Windows and Unix. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, exercises and new features of S-PLUS and R as they are introduced. Dr Venables is a Senior Statistician with the CSIRO in Australia. He has given many courses on statistical computing, data analysis and graphics using S in Australia, Europe and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition and neural networks. They are the joint authors of `S Programming', the authoritative guide to using the S language.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This chapter covers the important topic of deep learning. At the time of deep learning writing (2020), deep learning is a very active area of research in the machine learning and artificial intelligence communities. The cornerstone of deep learning is the neural network. neural network Neural networks rose to fame in the late 1980s. There was a lot of excitement and a certain amount of hype associated with this approach, and they were the impetus for the popular Neural Information Processing Systems meetings (NeurIPS, formerly NIPS) held every year, typically in exotic places like ski resorts. This was followed by a synthesis stage, where the properties of neural networks were analyzed by machine learners, mathematicians and statisticians; algorithms were improved, and the methodology stabilized. Then along came SVMs, boosting, and random forests, and neural networks fell somewhat from favor. Part of the reason was that neural networks required a lot of tinkering, while the new methods were more automatic. Also, on many problems the new methods outperformed poorly-trained neural networks. This was the status quo for the first decade in the new millennium. All the while, though, a core group of neural-network enthusiasts were pushing their technology harder on ever-larger computing architectures and data sets. Neural networks resurfaced after 2010 with the new name deep learning, with new architectures, additional bells and whistles, and a string of success stories on some niche problems such as image and video classification , speech and text modeling. Many in the field believe that the major reason for these successes is the availability of ever-larger training datasets, made possible by the wide-scale use of digitization in science and industry. In this chapter we discuss the basics of neural networks and deep learning , and then go into some of the specializations for specific problems, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time series and other sequences.

abstract = {Data mining is the art and science of intelligent data analysis. By building knowledge from information, data mining adds considerable value to the ever increasing stores of electronic data that abound today. In performing data mining many decisions need to be made regarding the choice of methodology, the choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of algorithms.Throughout this book the reader is introduced to the basic concepts and some of the more popular algorithms of data mining. With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing.The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.},

abstract = {Based on a well-established and popular course taught by the authors over many years, Stochastic Processes: An Introduction, Third Edition, discusses the modelling and analysis of random experiments, where processes evolve over time. The text begins with a review of relevant fundamental probability. It then covers gambling problems, random walks, and Markov chains. The authors go on to discuss random processes continuous in time, including Poisson, birth and death processes, and general population models, and present an extended discussion on the analysis of associated stationary processes in queues. The book also explores reliability and other random processes, such as branching, martingales, and simple epidemics. A new chapter describing Brownian motion, where the outcomes are continuously observed over continuous time, is included. Further applications, worked examples and problems, and biographical details have been added to this edition. Much of the text has been reworked. The appendix contains key results in probability for reference. This concise, updated book makes the material accessible, highlighting simple applications and examples. A solutions manual with fully worked answers of all end-of-chapter problems, and Mathematica{\textregistered} and R programs illustrating many processes discussed in the book, can be downloaded from crcpress.com.},

abstract = {Aim: We previously demonstrated that HbA1c is strongly associated with adverse outcome in pre-gestational diabetic pregnancy. This study investigates the additional impact of maternal body mass index (BMI). Methods: Data from627 pregnancies >=24 weeks' gestation thatwere part of the national diabetes in pregnancy data set between 2007 and 2008 were stratified by maternal BMI. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes were analysed. Healthy weight (HW) was defined as BMI <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, overweight (OW) BMI 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obese (OB) BMI >=30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Results: In Type 1 diabetes 44.3 per cent women had HW, 36.9 per cent OW, 18.8 per cent OB. In Type 2 diabetes 9.1 per cent had HW, 17.3 per cent OW, 73.6 per cent OB (P < 0.0005). There was no difference across the BMI groups for pregnancy preparation (preconception folic acid and HbA1c <7 per cent; delivery by caesarean section (HW 60.0 per cent, OW 63.6 per cent and OB 54.5 per cent women; P = 0.15) or serious adverse outcomes (congenital malformation, stillbirth, neonatal death) (HW 7 per cent, OW4.3 per cent, OB 7.7 per cent; P = 0.32). OB women were less likely to deliver before 37 weeks (HW 51.6 per cent, OW 45.8 per cent, OB 35.7 per cent; P = 0.05). Infants of these women were less likely to be large for gestational age(HW51.6 per cent,OW45.8 per cent,OB35.7 per cent; P = 0.0004),extremelylarge forgestationalage(HW36.3percent,OW 31.3 per cent, OB 23.9 per cent; P = 0.02) or require a higher level of neonatal care (HW43.9 per cent,OW46.5 per cent, OB 30.7 per cent; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that maternal BMI did not attenuate the association between HbA1c and perinatal morbidity. Conclusion: Increased maternal BMI was associated with reduced pre-term delivery, large for gestational age babies and neonatal care. Thissuggeststheseverityofglycaemicdisturbanceis thekeydeterminant of perinatalmorbidity in pre-gestational diabetic pregnancy.},

abstract = {Over the recent years, the statistical programming language R has become an integral part of the curricula of econometrics classes we teach at the University of Duisburg-Essen. We regularly found that a large share of the students, especially in our introductory undergraduate econometrics courses, have not been exposed to any programming language before and thus have difficulties to engage with learning R on their own. With little background in statistics and econometrics, it is natural for beginners to have a hard time understanding the benefits of having R skills for learning and applying econometrics. These particularly include the ability to conduct, document and communicate empirical studies and having the facilities to program simulation studies which is helpful for, e.g., comprehending and validating theorems which usually are not easily grasped by mere brooding over formulas. Being applied economists and econometricians, all of the latter are capabilities we value and wish to share with our students. Instead of confronting students with pure coding exercises and complementary classic literature like the book by Venables and Smith (2010), we figured it would be better to provide interactive learning material that blends R code with the contents of the well-received textbook Introduction to Econometrics by Stock and Watson (2015) which serves as a basis for the lecture. This material is gathered in the present book Introduction to Econometrics with R, an empirical companion to Stock and Watson (2015). It is an interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report and enables students not only to learn how results of case studies can be replicated with R but also strengthens their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other empirical applications.},

abstract = {Advanced Methods for Data Analysis (36-402/36-608) Spring 2014 1 Generalized linear models 1.1 Introduction: two regressions • So far we've seen two canonical settings for regression. Let X ∈ R p be a vector of predictors. In linear regression, we observe Y ∈ R, and assume a linear model: E(Y |X) = $\beta$ T X, for some coefficients $\beta$ ∈ R p. In logistic regression, we observe Y ∈ {0, 1}, and we assume a logistic model log P(Y = 1|X) 1 − P(Y = 1|X) = $\beta$ T X. • What's the similarity here? Note that in the logistic regression setting, P(Y = 1|X) = E(Y |X). Therefore, in both settings, we are assuming that a transformation of the conditional expectation E(Y |X) is a linear function of X, i.e., g E(Y |X) = $\beta$ T X, for some function g. In linear regression, this transformation was the identity transformation g(u) = u; in logistic regression, it was the logit transformation g(u) = log(u/(1 − u)) • Different transformations might be appropriate for different types of data. E.g., the identity transformation g(u) = u is not really appropriate for logistic regression (why?), and the logit transformation g(u) = log(u/(1 − u)) not appropriate for linear regression (why?), but each is appropriate in their own intended domain • For a third data type, it is entirely possible that transformation neither is really appropriate. What to do then? We think of another transformation g that is in fact appropriate, and this is the basic idea behind a generalized linear model 1.2 Generalized linear models • Given predictors X ∈ R p and an outcome Y , a generalized linear model is defined by three components: a random component, that specifies a distribution for Y |X; a systematic component , that relates a parameter $\eta$ to the predictors X; and a link function, that connects the random and systematic components • The random component specifies a distribution for the outcome variable (conditional on X). In the case of linear regression, we assume that Y |X ∼ N (µ, $\sigma$ 2), for some mean µ and variance $\sigma$ 2. In the case of logistic regression, we assume that Y |X ∼ Bern(p) for some probability p.},

abstract = {Is a large portion of medicine more dependent on proper observance of routine procedures than universities are willing to acknowledge? Has there been adequate differentiation between the need to search for new technology and the need to review existing technologies in order to make technology available and ready for use in health care? In answering such questions it must be realised that technology and personnel cannot be separated. Technology cannot be applied to health care delivery without appropriate delivery teams. The art and science of technology is the tool of the clinical engineer who works alongside the health care providers. The author stresses that the physician must ensure that laboratory units and other automated facilities are guided by the clinician in order to remain an efficient tool. The cost of health care will go up as advances in technology are made. As diagnosis can be established earlier and treatment begun more rapidly, the need for some current time consuming techniques and less effective procedures could be eliminated.},

Molecular genetic studies on classification and phylogeny of A. cantonensis in Thailand are limited. This study surveyed A. cantonensis larvae prevalence in natural intermediate hosts across Thailand and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. A total of 14,032 freshwater and land snails were collected from 19 provinces of Thailand. None of Filopaludina sp, Pomacea sp, and Cyclophorus sp were infected with Angiostrongylus larvae, whereas Achatina fulica, Cryptozona siamensis, and Megaustenia siamensis collected from Kalasin, Kamphaeng Phet, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, and Tak Provinces were infected, with C. siamensis being the common intermediate host. Based on morphology, larvae isolated from 11 samples of these naturally infected snails preliminarily were identified as A. cantonensis. Comparison of partial nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene revealed that four sequences are identical to A. cantonensis haplotype ac4 from Bangkok and the other seven to that of A. cantonensis isolate AC Thai, indicating two independent lineages of A. cantonensis in Thailand.},

Similar objects are grouped together in clusters so that one can then work with the few cluster descriptors instead of the many data points. The quality of any given clustering is measured by a loss function that takes into account both the parsimony of the clustering and the loss of information due to clustering. An optimal clustering can be obtained by minimizing the theoretical loss function. It is shown that a sample version of the loss function and optimal clustering converge strongly to their theoretical counterparts as the sample size tends to infinity. We then develop a bootstrap-based procedure for obtaining approximate confidence bounds on the number of clusters in the “best” clustering. The effectiveness of this procedure is evaluated in a simulation study. An application is presented. {\textcopyright} 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

An abridged description of biostatistical principles and analysis sequence keys are combined together with worked examples of the practical use of R into a complete practical guide to designing and analyzing real biological research. Topics covered include: simple hypothesis testing, graphing. exploratory data analysis and graphical summaries. regression (linear, multi and non-linear). simple and complex ANOVA and ANCOVA designs (including nested, factorial, blocking, spit-plot and repeated measures). frequency analysis and generalized linear models. Linear mixed effects modeling is also incorporated extensively throughout as an alternative to traditional modeling techniques.

abstract = {No one can be involved in aquaculture for very long without becoming aware of the extensive array of legislation within which the industry operates in Europe1. At the farm level, it may sometimes feel as if the legislation is a brake on development at a time when aquaculture is regularly proclaimed as the fastestgrowing food sector in the world. Are aquaculture producers in Europe to be disadvantaged in playing their part in the development of the industry, and from enjoying their share of the prizes? This would be of no benefit, and seems unlikely as a policy goal. Why would policy and its organising legislative framework conspire to disadvantage Europe in this regard? Yet at the operational level, the legislative net seems to tighten, and the associated costs of compliance to rise, in a sector where margins are already hard to maintain. The AQUAETREAT project was conceived in part as a response to such strengthening environmental legislation, at a time when its current and future impact on aquaculture was becoming increasingly apparent. How to reposition production operations to comply with more stringent environmental requirements, at the same time as achieving the improvements in efficiency necessary to remain viable? Legislation is not the only force shaping the industry. Technological development is playing a critical role in mediating the twin goals of increasing efficiency and compliance. Later chapters focus on technological aspects of development.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},
