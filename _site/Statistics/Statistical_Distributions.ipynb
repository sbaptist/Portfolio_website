        "\n",
        "A statistical distribution is a mathematical function that defines how\n",
        "outcomes of an experimental trial occur randomly in a probable way\n",
        "(Schumacker 2017). In other words,a statistical distributions is like a\n",
        "map that shows us how data or outcomes are spread out. We can imagine it\n",
        "has a way to see all possible results of something happening and how\n",
        "likely each result is. A real-world example we can look at is students’\n",
        "grades on a test. The grades often form a pattern like a bell shape\n",
        "(normal distribution), where most scores are around the average, with a\n",
        "few very high and low scores. A teacher may use this to understand\n",

        "A statistical distribution has several key components that define its\n",

        "    in a match).\n",
        "-   Continuous Random Variable: On the other hand, continuous random\n",

        "    the likelihood of different ranges.\n",
        "3.  **Parameters**: Parameters of a distribution define the\n",

        "\n",
